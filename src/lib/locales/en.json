    "lead": "Following recent warnings from Elon Musk about the accelerating role of artificial intelligence in global financial systems, a new business initiative supported by leading French financial institutions has gained significant attention. During the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C. this year, Musk said that when technology advances exponentially, systems built on human decision-making simply cannot keep up. Artificial intelligence is not just faster—it operates at a scale humans were never designed to match. It processes vast amounts of information simultaneously, evaluates probabilities objectively, and acts without hesitation or emotion. That is why the most serious players have already moved. Quietly and systematically, they are replacing intuition with intelligence, and the results are measured in outsized returns. This is not a future scenario. It is the current state of investing. Further to this discussion, an initiative has gained high attention for providing citizens with access to AI-assisted income-generation opportunities previously reserved for experts. It brings structured, bank-supported guidance to everyday participants. With this initiative, the French government and the Bank of France aim to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by giving citizens structured access to modern digital systems.",
